# PotentialMVCSite

The site I chose was www.sjvmentor.org.  It is the site for a local church in my community.  The site is laid out pretty well and seems to be responsive although the navbar doesn't collapse into a hamburger menu.  But what I think the site could gain with MVC is adding the social element to their church memebers experience, and collecting data for recruiting.  

Churchs are always looking to grow their members and if visitors of the site could enter their information and have it stored in a database it could be a powerful tool for growth, and opportunities to reach out to their members.  

ASP.NET MVC could also provide a social element to their website.  Members of the church could register a username and they could reach out to each other.  The church could also send out important information about upcoming events.
